# CasADi Car Control
This repository contains some of my autonomous car simulations using nonlinear model predictive control
This repository features a collection of my autonomous vehicle simulation projects. These projects showcase the use of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for tasks such as parallel parking and dynamic obstacle avoidance.

I added a date to indicate when I finished these projects.

1. (January 2025) Dynamic Obstacle avoidance using NMPC
